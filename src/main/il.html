        <h3>Dr. Richard Dallan</h3>
        <img class="portrait" src="resources/characters/dr-dalan.png">
        <div class="character-description">
        Dallan is a tall, burly, balding Caucasian man
        with grey, short, curly hair that has all but vanished
        on top, and a long beard and mustache. His glasses
        are oversize, black and thick, enlarging his eyes. He
        wears suspenders, slacks, and a short-sleeved, button-
        down shirt with no tie. Sometimes he wears a Boston
        White Sox windbreaker. He always wears sneakers.
        His physical presence is intimidating, but his personality
        is quiet and respectful. At 2.01 meters, he towers
        over his patients, but he is self-deprecating, quiet, and
        even-tempered. Within seconds, even those intimidated
        by his physical presence find themselves at ease
        becaue of the naturally calming nature of his voice.</div>

        <img class="portrait" src="resources/characters/dr-friend.png">
        <div class="character-description">
            Dr. Friend is a strange, loud little Caucasian man
            perpetually dressed in a pinstriped suit. His bald head
            and fastidiously kept grey spade beard make him
            appear comical. But his insightful, probing questions,
            usually followed by a veiled insult, quickly remove the
            humor evident in his appearance.

        <div class="character-description">
            Ed Debevic is a huge, violent-looking Caucasian
            man. His nose was long ago flattened by some
            calamitous injury. His narrow eyes squint at everything.
            His two front teeth are missing chunks as if
            they were smashed long ago. He carries “Thomas,” a
            sawn-down baseball bat shot with a center of lead, in
            a loop on his belt.

        <img class="portrait" src="resources/characters/nurse-sagamina.png">
        <div class="character-description">
            Nurse Esther Samigina is a curt, clever, and
            soft-spoken woman who appears to have it all under
            control. At work, she is always on task and never
            seems to rest. She never hesitates. She calls everyone
            by their full names. Patients cling to her as a surrogate
            mother, though she does not show emotion. No one
            has anything but kind things to say about her.
            Samigina is broad-faced and dark-haired, has
            piercing green eyes, and is meticulous in her appearance.
            She wears scrubs during work hours. After hours
            she is still often found in them underneath a hoodie or
            a pullover. Outside of work, her hair is always bound
            up in a hair scrunchie.

            is unkempt and looks ill, bundled in expensive silk pajamas and slippers. His
            eyes have a frantic, lost look. His hands
            are raw, waterlogged, and peeling, as if he had been
            doing heavy work in the water. He claims to be an architect, have
            built the Holden Place, and to have drowned multiple children</div>

        <div class="character-description">Gareth-Vance is a short young woman with wild blue
            and blonde hair. Usually she is quiet and self-deprecating
            but she suffers from manic delusions of omnipotence.
            When these spells strike, she is argumentative
            and dismissive, raises her voice, and threatens those
            nearby with what limited violence she might be able
            to muster. She spends much of her time during the
            day making origami sculptures of small animals: dogs,
            penguins, and cranes.</div>

        <img class="portrait" src="resources/characters/david-langford.jpeg">
        <div class="character-description">Langford was born in Jersey City, New Jersey, and attended
            DeVry University for trade training in network
            systems, electronics, and machinery repair. Soon after
            landing a job with NYNEX as a telephone maintenance
            engineer at 24, he married and shortly thereafter
            divorced his first wife, Beth. When he switched
            jobs in 1991 and became a “box man” for Charter
            Cable systems at age 38, he married his second wife,
            Patty. They divorced in 1993. Langford was a bachelor
            who lived alone in an apartment in Staten Island.
            Langford was once handsome and garrulous. His
            lost time on the Night Floors was cruel. After his
            experience he was commited to Dorchester.</div>

            An attractive woman in her early thirties, Carver
            confesses readily to being in the “sanatorium” to deal
            with her drug problem, but she does not say which
            drug. Carver can find and refine Melonia.

            Yale is an older, dark-haired woman with a wide,
            fish-like face that is always consumed with a guarded,
            worried look. She can hear the voices of
            the dead through electronic devices. She has an uncanny
            ability to know when someone carries electronics,
            even if they are concealed.

        <h3>Ed Wist/Mr. Wilde</h3>
        <img class="portrait" src="resources/characters/ed-wist.png">
        <div class="character-description">
            Wist, born Ed Miler
            Guison, murdered his father, mother, and sister with
            a shotgun in 2010, on his 16th birthday. His story is
            well known because of his obscene wealth and his
            very public trial. The murders are often called the
            “Poor Little Rich Boy Murders” in the press. The state
            of California convicted Wist of murder, but he successfully
            pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. The
            family trust selected the Dorchester House as Wist’s
            new home and persuaded the California courts to
            send him there. He has lived on the third floor in the
            north dorm for one year. He sometimes has trouble
            remembering his life before the hospital.
            Despite multiple failed lawsuits by far-flung relatives,
            in April 2015, on his 21st birthday, Wist came
            into possession of his wealth, a trust fund amounting
            to hundreds of millions of dollars. Few patients in
            Dorchester House know the truth of Wist’s background.
            He works hard to be charming and selfdeprecating,
            portraying himself as a penniless drudge.
            Wist is never without his small, brown leather
            notebook, his “reputation book.”

            Wide, recently healed scars can be seen on his wrists.
            Pailotte is convinced that this world is not real and
            that he is serving time in Hell. Only death can free
            him.

            A Caucasian man of middle age, Wilde has a stunted
            build the size of a ten-year-old boy. He has a yellowed
            complexion, a deformed head, and a scarred face.
            He wears false wax ears over the ruined flaps where
            ears once were. Wilde nevertheless projects an air of
            physical danger. His arms are thickly muscled and his
            agility is obvious from his lithe movements.

            or at least has reached the point where his acute
            depression is gone. In the past few months, however,
            Valater has noticed strange “puppets” moving

        <div class="character-description">
            Bael suffered through two tours in Iraq, but soon
            found his fears followed him home. He committed
            himself, and had been enjoying steady progress until
            the forces of the King seized the facility. Now, Bael is
            somehow the master and creator of classical demonology,
            which the forces of the King have somehow
            seeded for him throughout history.
            Bael is a thickly muscled Caucasian man with
            crew-cut short blond hair fading to grey at the temples.
            He wears a thick, woolen robe, but beneath it,
            his body is covered in tattoos, including one of Mr.
            Toad and the Cheshire Cat on his neck. He is never
            without his battered, wire-bound, red notebook.
